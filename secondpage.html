              There are plenty of main ways of not Conserving water and your probably doing it for awhile.

            <p>
              Conserving water prevents greenhouse gas emissions associated with treating and distributing water.  Overloading municipal sewer systems can also cause untreated sewage to flow to lakes and rivers. The smaller the amount of water flowing through these systems, the lower the likelihood of pollution. In some communities, costly sewage system expansion has been avoided by community-wide household water conservation.<br><br>

            <p>
              A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day. Larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons.In-sink ‘garburators’ require lots of water to operate properly, and also add considerably to the volume of solids in a septic tank, which can lead to maintenance problems. And these are just the main causes!
