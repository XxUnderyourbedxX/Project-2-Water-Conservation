              The main ways on getting Involved on conserving water!
            </h1>
            <p>
              Fit Household Faucets with Aerators This easy and effective home water conservation method is also the cheapest! A simple low-flow aerator saves water in the bathroom.<br><br> Turn Off the Water After You Wet Your Toothbrush There is no need to keep the water running while brushing your teeth. Just wet your brush and fill a glass for mouth rinsing. Rinse Your Razor in the Sink Fill the sink with a few inches of warm water. This will rinse your razor just as well as running water, with far less waste of water.<br><br>

              Put a little food coloring in your toilet tank. If, without flushing, the color begins to appear in the bowl within 30 minutes, you have a leak that should be repaired immediately. Most replacement parts are inexpensive and easy to install.

              Use Your Water Meter to Check for Hidden Water Leaks
              Read the house water meter before and after a two-hour period when no water is being used. If the meter does not read exactly the same, there is a leak.
